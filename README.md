# hello-world
My name is Unachukwu Elvis Chinemerem. Popularly known as Pablomacanacii. I am intending to become a computer programmer especially in the aspect of web developing. I already have some background knowledge like html, Introduction to CSS. I pray this site help me reach my dream of becoming an international, classic computer programmer
Nevertheless, i've decided to widen out and acquire more useful skills. The Data Science Course is an impactful and practical programme. With the skills just acquired, i hope to attain more positions in the IT Field whilst still grabbing more with the time left.
